2. Full **podcasting** capabilities, including custom podcasts for individual users.
3. Sermons uploaded in mp3 format can be **played directly** on your website using the [1PixelOut Audio Player](http://wpaudioplayer.com/).
4. An optional **sidebar widget** displays sermons on all of your posts or pages.

6. **Other file types** can also be uploaded, including PDF, Powerpoint, Word, text and RTF. Multiple files can be attached to single sermons.
7. The **full Bible text** of the passage being preached on can be included on each sermon page (nine different versions, including ESV).
8. Files can be uploaded to your own site **through the browser or via FTP**. Alternatively you can use other free audio hosting sites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

A [comprehensive FAQ](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/faq) is available on the plugin's home page.

== Screenshots ==

1. **Displaying sermons on your website:** This first screen shot shows how Sermon Browser looks to your readers. This particular search shows only those sermons preached from 1 Corinthians. Each of the sermons has audio files, but one also has an embedded video. On the left-hand side you can see the widget showing the most recent sermons preached. At the top you can see a link to both the full podcast, and lower down to a custom podcast.
2. **The single sermon page (with Bible text):** This next screenshot shows the detail for one sermon. You can see additional links to other sermons preached around that time, plus the complete ESV text of the passage being preached on.
3. **Editing a sermon:** The third screenshot shows the main editing window. You can see a wide variety of information can be entered, including the bible passage being preached on, and any files linked to the sermon. Any number of Bible passages can be included, and any number of files (e.g. you could attach an mp3 file for the audio recording, a powerpoint file, and a word document of PDF of the sermon text).
4. **Using the template facility:** The final screenshot shows the options screen with its powerful templating facility. With a little knowledge of HTML and CSS and the Sermon Browser [template tags](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/template-tags), you can easily adapt Sermon Browser's output to suit your own requirements. SermonBrowser produces valid XHTML code, using semantically correct markup and is fully standards compliant.

== Customising SermonBrowser ==

You can customise Sermon Browser to fit in with your own theme, and to display or hide whatever information you choose. If you want to create an extra page on your site that just shows a few sermons (for example, just the sermons preached at a recent conference), use [shortcodes](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/shortcodes).

If you want to customise how Sermon Browser appears throughout your site, use [Template tags](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/template-tags)
