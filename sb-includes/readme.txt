== Description ==

The Sermon Browser Wordpress Plugin allows churches to simply upload sermons to their website, where they can be searched, listened to, and downloaded. It is easy to use with comprehensive help and tutorials. Features include:

1. Sermons can be **searched** by topic, preacher, bible passage or date.
2. Full **podcasting** capabilities, including custom podcasts for individual users.
3. Sermons uploaded in mp3 format can be **played directly** on your website using the [1PixelOut Audio Player](http://wpaudioplayer.com/).
4. An optional **sidebar widget** displays sermons on all of your posts or pages.
5. **Embed videos** and other flash files from sites such as [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) or [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/).
6. **Other file types** can also be uploaded, including PDF, Powerpoint, Word, text and RTF. Multiple files can be attached to single sermons.
7. The **full Bible text** of the passage being preached on can be included on each sermon page (nine different versions, including ESV).
8. Files can be uploaded to your own site **through the browser or via FTP**. Alternatively you can use other free audio hosting sites.
9. Powerful **templating function** allows complete customisation to complement the look of your site.
10. Simple statistics show how often each sermon has been listened to.
11. Support for [Wordpress MU](http://mu.wordpress.org/) (WPMU).
12. Extensive **help** and [tutorial screencasts](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser#tutorial).
13. English and Spanish translations included.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin, and unzip it.
2. Place the sermon-browser folder in your wp-content/plugins folder and upload it to your website.
3. Activate the plugin from the plugins tab of your Wordpress admin.
4. You may have to [change the permissions](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/faq#chmod) the upload folder (by default wp-content/uploads/sermons).
5. Create a Wordpress page with the text [sermons]. The plugin will display your sermons on this page.
6. You can also display sermons (filtered according to your criteria) on additional pages or posts by using [shortcodes](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/shortcodes). 

#### Installation in Wordpress MU
1. Download the plugin, and unzip it.
2. Place the contents of the sermon-browser folder in your wp-content/mu-plugins folder and upload it to your website.
3. The plugin will be automatically activated and available for each user.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

A [comprehensive FAQ](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/faq) is available on the plugin's home page.

== Screenshots ==

1. **Displaying sermons on your website:** This first screen shot shows how Sermon Browser looks to your readers. This particular search shows only those sermons preached from 1 Corinthians. Each of the sermons has audio files, but one also has an embedded video. On the left-hand side you can see the widget showing the most recent sermons preached. At the top you can see a link to both the full podcast, and lower down to a custom podcast.
2. **The single sermon page (with Bible text):** This next screenshot shows the detail for one sermon. You can see additional links to other sermons preached around that time, plus the complete ESV text of the passage being preached on.
3. **Editing a sermon:** The third screenshot shows the main editing window. You can see a wide variety of information can be entered, including the bible passage being preached on, and any files linked to the sermon. Any number of Bible passages can be included, and any number of files (e.g. you could attach an mp3 file for the audio recording, a powerpoint file, and a word document of PDF of the sermon text).
4. **Using the template facility:** The final screenshot shows the options screen with its powerful templating facility. With a little knowledge of HTML and CSS and the Sermon Browser [template tags](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/template-tags), you can easily adapt Sermon Browser's output to suit your own requirements. SermonBrowser produces valid XHTML code, using semantically correct markup and is fully standards compliant.

== Customising SermonBrowser ==

You can customise Sermon Browser to fit in with your own theme, and to display or hide whatever information you choose. If you want to create an extra page on your site that just shows a few sermons (for example, just the sermons preached at a recent conference), use [shortcodes](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/shortcodes).

If you want to customise how Sermon Browser appears throughout your site, use [Template tags](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/sermon-browser/template-tags).
